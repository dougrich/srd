## Navigating

On the left side of the page is the _navbar_. It has five icons:

* <i class="icon-search"></i> Search
* <i class="icon-books"></i> Reference
* <i class="icon-hammer2"></i> Site Policy
* <i class="icon-cog"></i> Guide
* <i class="icon-connection"></i> Connection

While navigating, the ribbon will guide you back to the section you're in.

## Finding Content

There are two ways to find content - either *Searching* or *Referencing*.

#### Searching

Searching is the primary experience. You type and the system will guess what you could be looking for. This is best used when you have a *specific* goal in mind, like quickly finding the barbarian progression tree.

#### Referencing

Referencing is more of a traditional style of navigating - you do so by looking through a tree, glossary, or alphabetical list of content. This allows you a more general overview of a topic - you might want to know about classes in general, rather than looking for a specific class.

## Using Offline

This site uses your browser's application cache to provide an offline experience. So long as you have visited the site once and not cleared your cache, you can use the site offline. To facilitate this on mobile, you should add this app to your homescreen.

The <i class="icon-connection"></i> Connection icon gives you the status of your connection:

* *Green* means the site is connected and up to date.
* *Yellow* means the site is connected and has downloaded an update; clicking will give you the latest content.
* *Greyed Out* means the site is disconnected.

At any time you can click the icon to check for any new changes.

## Overall Goals

* Fully support offline usage
* Fully support mobile users
* Emphasize clean, simple design
* Minimize ad presence
* Maximize usability
